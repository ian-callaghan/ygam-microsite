    YGAM’s recent survey amongst higher education students highlights that many are turning to video games and gambling in an attempt to
    relieve financial and academic pressures of university.

    Over 2,000 students in higher education took part in the survey and whilst a large number of those asked said that they enjoyed the
    social side of both gaming and gambling, the results indicate that it can also have a negative impact on the academic performance of
    students and the quality of their friendships and social activities. In addition, for the students who gamble, nearly half said that
    they are constantly concerned about their financial situation.

    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2rem">Summary of results</span>
    <br />
    <p>
        <strong>• Gaming is a popular way to reduce stress.</strong> Students are finding the university experience stressful. With 79% of
        students playing digital games, easing the pressures may be a positive benefit but 48% of those who game every day said it has got
        in the way of friendships and studies.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>• The more frequently students game, the greater the impact.</strong>
        The research revealed that for those who game every day, one fifth have a negative sense of belonging at university, and over
        one-third say it has got in the way of their social life.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>• 264,000 students in the UK are at some risk from gambling</strong>
        with around 88,000 already defined as problem gamblers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            • 59% of students who gamble say they are always worrying about their financial situation
        </strong>
        while 16% have gambled more than they could afford.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>• Students gamble to escape the stresses of university.</strong> For students who are moderate risk or problem gamblers the
        findings show they are more likely to gamble to ‘cheer them up when they are depressed’, even though 9 in 10 feel guilty about the
        way they have gambled.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            • One third of these students say their gambling habits have a negative effect on their wellbeing,
        </strong>
        over half have considered dropping out of university and one in seven have a negative perception of their overall university
        experience.

    <strong>Helen Rhodes, Programme Director</strong> at the <strong>Gambling Commission</strong> said: “We welcome this research by YGAM
    which provides further information, detail and understanding on the relationship between young people and gambling.
</content-block>

<!--Info-->
<content-block>
    There are a variety of actions and educational initiatives which are connected with the research and it is important these are
    undertaken in a planned, joined-up way. The National Strategy to Reduce Gambling Harms, launched earlier this year, will be the most
    effective way to ensure this vital coordination and partnership work takes place and drives faster progress to reducing gambling harms.
    We look forward to working with colleagues at YGAM in the months ahead.”
